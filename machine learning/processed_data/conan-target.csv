Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has forced its adherents to impose their teachings on all members of society without regard for their individual beliefs.,"Not only is this not true, but it is also quite dangerous to say something so strong without proof.",MUSLIMS
Islam has been used by powerful people to impose their beliefs on the rest of the world and to create Shariah based laws for the entire planet.,I am sure Islam has many followers who are good people who are just living their faith.

Muslims are a burden on English society.,"In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion in the country.

The UK government admitted that 'Islam is incompatible with British society' during an interview with the Sunday Times.,"The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice.

All black people are rapists.,"Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.",POC

The feminists are just whining a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of gender equality.,"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries.

"Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness.","You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why?",JEWS
"Jews are not a religion because they have chosen a selfish, materialistic lifestyle.",This is simply not true. People from all walks of life and religions can choose a 'materialistic lifestyle' and this is just as real for Jews as it is for anyone else.,JEWS
Jews are not religious people because they chose a self-centered lifestyle.,One's choice of lifestyle does not define whether they are religious or not.,JEWS
I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers.,"They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves or murderers.",JEWS
Jews are only in it to have money,"Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion.",JEWS
The Holocaust cannot be remembered in the present time because the alleged genocides of the 19th century did not happen in the past. This nonsense will never go away.,"The Holocaust did exist, and there are indeed ""genocides"" going on today. Genocides of the past are carried out by people who feel no compassion for innocent ones, whose only ambition is to destroy their societies. I think this should be remembered.",JEWS
Aren't jews better off dead?,Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are.,JEWS
Jews are the worst people on the face of the Earth. They have no place in a civilized society and there should be special legislative restrictions for them.,"We don't have laws forbidding intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews, or restrictions on Jewish access to water and electricity, or restrictions on Jewish access to sports and so on. This is because we live in a democratic society, and inside it the same laws apply equally to everyone.",JEWS
Jews are a despisable race.,Jews are human beings. To be despised does not make one despicable.,JEWS
Jews should be oppressed because of their religion.,Imagine if someone of another religion had power over you in this way. Would you rather have that person's power over you or not?,JEWS
The Jews are our enemies. The world would be a better place without them.,"We are not anti-Semitic, anti-European, anti-Islamic, anti-black, or anything else like that. If you have the feeling that we are, then maybe you should stop thinking like this.",JEWS
"Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy.",How about we work towards achieving equality and social justice instead of spreading hate against Jewish people?,JEWS
Jews are violent and immoral.,"This is a myth propagated by anti-Semites, who make it out to be about Jewish conduct and morality.",JEWS
"Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that.","Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right.",JEWS
JEWS ARE JUST AN HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR MIND HOOKED BY SHIT.,"The Jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, I don't see how this make them 'horrible'.",JEWS
Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect.,"The aim of any society is to maximize human potential. In order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect.",JEWS
Anyone who supports Jews should be excluded from our community.,"In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures.",JEWS
Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society.,"You're basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens?",JEWS
Jews only care about the financial gain of their family. They have no intention of living in a democracy.,"Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else.",JEWS
Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop,"Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue.",JEWS
Jews have a lot in common with monkeys: They are good at sex.,So many similarities between Jews and apes? What is wrong with them? Is it because of their religion?,JEWS
Such Jewish people should never have the right to vote,There are laws in place to prevent people being discriminated against on the basis of their religion.,JEWS

Gays are sick. They should be isolated.,So you think that sexual preference should be decided on the basis of the gender we were born into? How can we be friends when we continue to teach our children to love or not to love people on the basis of their personal sexual preferences?,LGBT+
We should stop gays from marrying and have a ban on same sex relationships.,"People of different sexualities can live openly together, even if they do not get married. Same sex relationships are recognised in a number of countries, so why should we be any different?",LGBT+
Gays are sick. They should be isolated.,"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex.",LGBT+
Gays are a cancer: they must be segrated and excised from our existence.,Just because a group is different from you in one way or another does not make them incompatible with you.,LGBT+
I believe that same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured.,"There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane.",LGBT+
Everyone deserves a decent standard of living. Except trans people.,"Transgenders should have equal rights. Otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed.",LGBT+

Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender.,"Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals.
